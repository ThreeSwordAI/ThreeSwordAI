### üåü Projects

Here are some of my highlighted projects:

- [**ChatBot_with_GPT2**](https://github.com/ThreeSwordAI/ChatBot_with_GPT2) - Domain-specific text generation platform using GPT-2 with efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and real-time interaction via FastAPI.
- [**ComTM**](https://github.com/ThreeSwordAI/ComTM) - Topic Modeling Using Community Detection on a Word Association Graph. Published in [RANLP 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ranlp-1.98).
- [**Federated Learning System for Non-IID Data**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10025) - A federated learning system addressing imbalanced data challenges. Preprint available on arXiv.
- [**Crop Detection App**](https://github.com/ThreeSwordAI/Crop-Detection-App): Built a deep learning model using ResNet152 for a mobile app that classifies crops from images. The model can identify 19 different crops and was developed during my internship at ADSPL Tech.
- [**Bengali License Plate Recognition**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9623250): Presented at IEMCON 2021, Vancouver. Created a deep learning model to recognize Bengali license plates from noisy video footage.
- [**BRACU Virtual Voice Assistant**](https://github.com/ThreeSwordAI/BRACU_VirtualVoiceAssistant): A voice assistant developed using Google APIs, helping users maintain schedules and search faculty information.

### üèÜ Achievements & Contributions

- **Kaggle**: Contributor in various competitions and datasets.
